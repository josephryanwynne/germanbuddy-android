German Buddy for Android
========================

This app is intended to provide basic information and tips on the German language. It's a project for myself to get a little bit of exposure to Android development but I am hoping it will be useful as an aid to learning German whilst I learn with Duolingo.

Duolingo is a great way to pick up some skills in a language, but the app lacks some basic things which might help users along the way:
 - Definitions of the cases and how to use them
 - Simple vocabulary builder for common words, INCLUDING the article (potentially game based later on)
 - Tips on how to conjugate verbs
 - Examples of some common irregular verbs (this feature will probably tie into the vocabulary builder eventually)
 - Descriptions of other grammatical principles and rules

Hopefully it will compliment my use of Duolingo to develop my understanding and vocabulary and teach me something about Android development. If you've stumbled across this, please don't judge too harshly as this is going to be my first attempt at both aspects here.
